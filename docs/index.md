# 🧭 Overview

These notes collect **things I actively use, build, or teach** in the lab.  
They are not meant to be complete or polished documentation.

This is a **living workspace**.

- 🟢 I add notes when I touch something
- 🟡 I do **not** go back to inventory everything
- 🔵 Some topics are deep, others are just reminders


If something is missing, it usually means *I’m not working on it right now.*

## 🐍 Coding notes & Python workflow

Practical notes on how I write and maintain code, mostly in Python.

This section is part **personal memo**, part **seminar-style material** for students:

- 📦 project structure and small tools
- 🐍 Python packages and environments
- 🔁 reproducibility, scripts, and automation
- ✂️ things that save time instead of adding abstraction

Expect uneven depth — this mirrors real work.

## 🔧 Lab hardware & experimental tools

An evolving description of **what we actually use in the lab**:

- ⚡ purchased equipment (PSUs, welders, controllers)
- 🧩 in-house electronics (ADC/DAC boards, custom PCBs)
- 🔍 small but important tools that don’t fit in manuals
- 🧪 experimental assemblies as they exist *right now*

This is not an inventory.  
It documents **current practice**, not history.

## 🎓 Student seminars

Material for student-facing seminars and guided discussions.

At the moment:
- ▶️ one active seminar

This section grows only when a seminar is running.

---

## 🧰 Software & tools

A collection of software tools, scripts, and repositories used across experiments:

- 🐍 Python tools
- 📈 data viewers
- 🎛️ control software
- 🧠 modeling and analysis codes

Some are standalone utilities, others are parts of a larger ecosystem.

(See [Software & tools](other-tools.md) for the curated list.)

## 📝 Notes on scope and intent

These docs are:
- 🚧 incomplete by design
- 🕰️ written during active work
- ✏️ occasionally rough or unfinished

They exist to support **doing experiments and teaching**,  
not to look finished.
