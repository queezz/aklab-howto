## About

The device consists of a precise, low-offset, linear Hall circuit with a copper conduction path located near the surface of the die.  
Applied current flowing through this copper conduction path generates a magnetic field which the Hall IC converts into a proportional voltage.  

Device accuracy is optimized through the close proximity of the magnetic signal to the Hall transducer.  
A precise, proportional voltage is provided by the low-offset, chopper-stabilized BiCMOS Hall IC, which is programmed for accuracy after packaging.
