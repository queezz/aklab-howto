**Quadrupole Residual Gas Analyzer (RGA)**

## Product Overview

The **ULVAC Qulee BGM2-102** is a compact quadrupole residual gas analyzer designed for **process monitoring and diagnostics in vacuum systems**.  
It combines a **wide dynamic range**, **high sensitivity using an electron multiplier**, and a **standalone display unit**, allowing both PC-based and PC-less operation.

The BGM2-102 is well suited for **thin-film deposition systems, plasma devices, vacuum furnaces, and R&D vacuum setups**, where continuous monitoring of gas composition is required.
