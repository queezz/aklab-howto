This was our first "orchestrator" for the plasma device.  
Purpose was simple: **log signals** (pressures, currents) and **control gas flow**.

The "box" evolved for more than 6 years. Along the way, both I and my students learned a lot.  
But now the time came to bring some sanity into this jungle—mostly because just turning a display on or off shifts the signals.  
Or maybe simply because the jungle grows.

In any case, **proper ground and EMI proofing** are now essential. Even if all you want is to check how pressure evolves over the weekend after a vent.

In this folder I’ll collect the modules we used in our Control Unit, the current state, and the updates.  
Maybe one day this will become a well-managed, easy-to-maintain, well-documented unit. For now—an overview and the component list.
