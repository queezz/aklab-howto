# Quick-Start Workflow: Designing a PCB in KiCad

---

## 1. Schematics

- Place component symbols from KiCad’s library.
- Use `labels` for nets instead of drawing wires everywhere (wires are fine for simple or localized connections).
- For connectors, use `generic connector symbols` and apply specific footprints later.

---

## 2. Assign Footprints

- In the Schematic Editor, assign proper footprints (e.g., resistor sizes, connector types).
- Supports reuse of symbols with different footprints easily. ([Reddit][2], [KiCad Documentation][3])

---

## 3. Create PCB Outline

- **Draw directly** in the PCB Editor (`Pcbnew`) on the `Edge.Cuts` layer.  
- **Import a DXF** outline. Easy option: in Autodesk Inventor, export the *flat face* of a part as DXF.


---

## 4. Arrange Components

- Place footprints thoughtfully: group connected components together, optimize routing paths, and place connectors conveniently along board edges.

---

## 5. Update & Route

- Use **Tools → Update PCB from Schematic (F8)** to sync the schematic with the board—imports footprints and net connections. ([KiCad Documentation][4], [Build Electronic Circuits][5], [KiCad Documentation][6])
- Route traces manually (or use the interactive router).
- Use labels and the "ratsnest" to guide connections visually.
- Optionally add copper fills like ground planes.

---

## 6. Validate & Generate Outputs

- Run **DRC (Design Rule Check)** to catch clearance, connectivity, or placement issues.
- Add silkscreen text, logos, or labels.
- Export your manufacturing files—**Gerbers**, drill files, and possibly 3D models.

# One-Page Cheat-Sheet

### KiCad PCB Quick Start Workflow

1. **Schematic**
   - Place symbols
   - Use labels for nets; wires ok if simple
   - Generic connectors → assign footprints later

2. **Assign Footprints**
   - Use schematic editor’s footprint assignment tool

3. **Board Outline**
   - Open PCB Editor
   - Import DXF into `Edge.Cuts` or draw manually

4. **Placement**
   - Arrange footprints to optimize routing
   - Position connectors at edges

5. **Update & Route**
   - `Update PCB from Schematic (F8)`
   - Route traces using ratsnest
   - Add copper fills (e.g., ground plane)

6. **Checks & Outputs**
   - Run DRC
   - Add silkscreen, labels, logos
   - Export Gerber and manufacturing files
